## Create two functions: one to cache the value of the inverse of a square matrix and the other to check 
## if this value is already computed and if so to retrieve it from the cache so we don't need to recompute it,
##  if not to caluculate it.

## This first function computes the inverse of the square matrix and caches it
    "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix`
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
